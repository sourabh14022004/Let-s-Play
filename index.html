          <h2>🥁 About the Drum Kit</h2>
          <p>
            The modern drum kit as we know it was born out of necessity and
            innovation — in the early 1900s, drummers began combining multiple
            percussion instruments into one setup, so a single drummer could
            play everything rather than having several people!
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            The bass drum pedal was invented because drummers wanted to free up
            their hands — so they could smoke cigars while playing!
          </p>
          <br />
