# Let me know if you want to:

- Add badges (e.g., GitHub stars, forks, license, etc.)
- Include deployment info (e.g., if it's live on Vercel or Netlify)
- Customize theme colors or styles for the instruments
- Auto-generate instrument keys using JS instead of hardcoding

I can help with all of that too!
